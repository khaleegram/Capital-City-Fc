- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) offers a clean, neutral backdrop that enhances readability and focuses attention on the content.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) is used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements like profile links, bringing a touch of elegance and signaling important actions without overwhelming the user.
- Complementary color: Black (#000000) for text and key UI elements, providing a strong contrast against the light background and burgundy accents.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, to convey a sense of tradition and prestige; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, because it's clear and easy to read, especially on screens.
- Use simple, consistent icons for player positions and video categories. Ensure that interactive elements are distinct.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure content is well-organized and easy to navigate. Utilize white space effectively to prevent a cluttered interface and to improve readability.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations when navigating between player profiles and videos. An example could be a smooth scrolling effect to load video thumbnails as the user scrolls, which avoids jarring changes.
